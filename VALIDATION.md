# Validation Coverage Matrix

The acceptance suite for the tool: every feature/scenario the engine must handle,
paired with **where its correct answer comes from** and **whether it's proven**.
This is a **living document** — every new check adds a row.

**Status legend**
- ✅ **Validated** — reproduces a published worked example (a golden answer key)
- ✍️ **Hand-derived** — no book example exists; verified by explicit arithmetic on
  validated components (documented in the test)
- ⏳ **Pending** — not yet built, or built with no validation case yet
- ⛔ **Deferred** — intentionally out of scope for now (errors clearly if invoked)

**Answer-key sources**
- **DABJ** worked examples (public): §9 (6 margins), Ex 8-b (stiffness), Ex 5-b
  (bearing allowable), Ex 6-a (thread pull-out — area/allowable cross-check);
  *untapped:* Ex 5-a, Ex 9-a (tension/sep-before-rupture).
- **Hand-calc**: for paths no book covers (rupture branch, thermal-from-stiffness,
  single-fastener slip, tear-out & under-head margins, thread-shear margins).
- **Group spreadsheet** (Phase 3.4, private): the real acceptance batch — flip repo private before it lands.
- **Thread-shear method note (Phase 3.3):** the thread checks use the GROUP'S
  practice — `As = 0.75·π·E·Le` (E = pitch diameter, Le = engagement) on BOTH the
  bolt-external and internal (nut/parent) sides — NOT TM-106943's printed 5/8·π
  external form (Eq. 63) and NOT DABJ §6's H28 tolerance-extreme form with the
  0.70 judgment knockdown. The DABJ Ex 6-a cross-check is therefore against the
  book's UN-KNOCKED area/allowable (0.0986 in² / 2,660 lb; the group form gives
  0.0999 in² / 2,698 lb, within 1.5%) — DABJ's knocked-down 1,860 lb is
  deliberately not reproduced. Inserts use the MANUFACTURER (Heli-Coil) rated
  pull-out load (single spec value), not a thread-shear calc; the fixture rating
  is anchored to the Heli-Coil Catalogue (Emhart 2003) p. 7 Nitronic 60 wire
  Ftu = 200 ksi (the catalogue tabulates no numeric pull-out loads — those live
  in Heli-Coil Technical Bulletin 68-2, not on hand).

## Coverage gaps (watch list)

- **Tapped-hole gap CLOSED (Phase 3.3)** — the parent-thread-shear check now
  exists (`engine.marginTappedParentThread`), cross-checked vs DABJ Ex 6-a
  (area/allowable) with a hand-derived MS. Remaining caveat: the threaded-in
  STIFFNESS frustum is still deferred, so insert/tapped Pb uses the assumed
  φ = 1 (conservative) — a group-spreadsheet case (Phase 3.4) should validate a
  real threaded-in φ.
- **Thread-shear MS values are hand-derived only** — no public worked example
  works a thread-shear MARGIN with the group's 0.75·π·E·Le area (DABJ Ex 6-a
  compares allowables and then knocks down); group-spreadsheet cases (Phase 3.4)
  should upgrade rows 7/8/9 to ✅.
- **Threads-in-shear interaction (Eq. 22/23)** — implemented as an error until a validation case exists.
- **Yield rupture branch (Eq. 11)** — deferred TODO in `marginBoltYield`.
- **Direct-preload & separation-critical preload** — direct-preload is now
  exercised indirectly by the tThreadShear fixtures (PpMax pinned); no dedicated
  fixture, and separation-critical still has none.
- **Mixed-modulus frustum** — deferred (needs slicing).
- **Tear-out & under-head margins are hand-derived only** — no public worked
  example works these margins (DABJ Ex 5-b compares bearing allowables only);
  group-spreadsheet cases (Phase 3.4) should upgrade rows 4/6 to ✅.
- **Tear-out below e/D = 1.5** — computed with a CAUTION flag (outside Eq. 69–71
  validity; Bruhn-type analysis needed); no numeric validation there.
- **DABJ §9 + Phase 3.2 interplay** — §9's library flange (Al 7075-T7351) carries
  handbook-fill Fbru/Fbry, so the Bearing row now EVALUATES on §9 (+5.775, Pass,
  hand-derived); tear-out/under-head stay NotEvaluated. WorstMargin/GoverningCheck
  (Slip −0.65) unchanged — pinned by tBearing (dabjSection9RegressionUnchanged).
- **DABJ §9 + Phase 3.3 interplay** — §9 is a Nut joint with no EngagementLength
  (and no frustum geometry), so all five thread rows resolve NotEvaluated and the
  answer key is untouched — pinned by tThreadShear (dabjSection9RegressionUnchanged).

## How this drives the plan
- **Phase 3.2 / 3.3:** each new check adds a row + a fixture (DABJ Ex 5-a/5-b/6-a where available, else hand-calc). ✅ done through 3.3 — all 15 checks implemented.
- **Phase 3.4 (second wave):** pull group-spreadsheet cases specifically to fill ⏳/✍️ rows — especially threaded-in and mixed-modulus.
- **Phase 5.3 (final validation):** re-run this entire matrix against the packaged `.exe`.
